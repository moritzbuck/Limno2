Hej,

So OK, I think it is all coming into shape. This a bit long, for the lazy ones, please jump to the end ...

For the detail of the sampling, shortly what it looks like right now, is is basically split in two sampling sets:

    Tuesday along the day we will sample all 20 mesocosms for the data that does not change (too much) over time (e.g. DNA, nutrients, DOC,...)
    From Monday to Wednesday we will sample 6 mesocosms for 48h  for RNA, YSI-measurements, dissolved gas, and bacterial production. We will sample every four hours. We will split in two teams ~5 people, one sampling the other one "resting", I will make a detailed schedule shortly...  1 person filtering, two using the YSI, one on the gas and one on bacterial production.

For the full sampling of the 20 mesocosms we will sample:

    DNA, two step filtration 3 micron followed by 0.2 micro, filtrate kept for viral 'omics (20 x 2 x screwcaps, 20 + 20 filter)
    TP/TN (Erken), DOC + one DOC for freezer (this is the usual weekly monitoring, which we will take off Charlotte, all tubes are ready)
    microbial counts (20 x screwcaps)
    sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, TOC (these I took from Sari's JÃ¤mntland protocol, maybe all is a bit overkill, but I will prepare the falcons anyhow) (20x 15mL falcon, 20x 3 50mL falcon)
    bacterial production (20x (3+1) screwcaps)
    CO2, CH4 (gaetan)
    ...

For the 48h sampling we will primarily measure 6 mesocosm (presumable, Bx,Bf, Ex, Ef, Hx, Hf, where the letter from A-J are nutrient level with A smallest, and x = no-fish, and f = fish) a total of 12 times, e.g. 72 samples:

    4 filters for RNA (72 x 4 x screwcaps + 72x 0.2 filters
    CO2/CH4 (gaetan)
    bacterial production (72x (3+1) screwcaps)
    cell-counts (72x 2mL epi/screwcaps)

Probably a bit less actually as when the 20 are sampled we will not need to do our select 6. Also a number of measurement are not mentioned her as they will be less regular or other are taking care (e.g. primary production, additional DNA filters, etc.).

This brings us roughly to a total of  for bulk stuff:

    72 x 4 + 20 x 0.2 filters : 308 (I have 5 boxes of hundred...)
    20x 3 micron filter (got)
    [72x4 + (72 + 20) x (3+1) + (72+20)] x 2mL screwcaps : 748 (I found around 350, I can borrow a bag of 500 from Javi upstairs ... )
    20x 15mL falcons (easy)
    60x 50mL falcons (easy)

I will print all the needed labels tomorrow, as well as buy baggies, so let me know if anything seams absurd. Also I will test the filtration setup.

Other additional things to remember:

    Nitrogen tanks
    extra tubes and syringes
    gloves
    prepare a good amount of alcohol (for cleaning)
    prepare some good alcohol (for relaxation)
    make some tables to fill out stuff
    make sure we have the YSI ready
    tube racks
    a bunch of timers
    bunch of iceboxes
    flash light
    plankton sieve (garage)
    finish checklist, and protocol (including storage locations)
    6 small bottles for BP
    
make a food shopping list
