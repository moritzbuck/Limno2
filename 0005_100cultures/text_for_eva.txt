16s community composition has already been sequenced from 300 mixed-cultures: 100 cultures were inoculated with ~10 cells from lake Erken, 200 were inoculated with ~100 cells from a lake in Jämntland, half of which being incubated anaerobically. These have all been grown in triple filter-sterilized water from the respective lakes. The Erken cultures were used to reconstruct the interaction network of the community (Fig. x and y). The cultures from Jämntland were used to culture communities able to oxidize or produce methane. Also number of members of the candidate phyla radiation (CPR) were grown in these cultures (Fig z).
Additionally around 600 cultures are incubating at the moment. These are growing in artificial lake water media. This media is extremely minimalistic, only containing minerals and a single (or no) carbon source. The carbon sources used are chitin and N-acetyl-glucosamine (the chitin monomer). We inoculated most of these cultures with ~10 cells from lake Erken, as well as some with 200microL of lake water as positive controls. These cultures will be used to study assembly of chitin degrading interaction as well as to establish a robust set of model communities for further study if interactions in freshwater environments.
